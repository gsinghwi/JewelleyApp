# JewelleryApp

A working prototype of a shop-management app for an Indian jewellery store moving from manual registers to a digital system. It covers:

- Customers (CRM)
- Sales and POS billing
- GST invoices
- Daily metal rates
- Stock
- Purchases from vendors
- Master data
- Reports
- A login page with the shop's own branding

## Run it

There's no install or build step. Open `index.html` in Chrome, Edge or Firefox. You can also serve the folder:

```bash
cd JewelleryApp
python3 -m http.server 8080   # then open http://localhost:8080
```

Demo logins (change them under **Settings → Users**):

| Role    | Username | Password     | Access |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Admin   | admin    | admin123     | Everything, including settings, branding and users |
| Manager | manager  | manager123   | Everything except settings and users |
| Sales   | sales    | sales123     | Dashboard, rates (view only), billing, invoices, customers, stock (view only) |

## Screens

| Screen | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Login** | Branded with the shop's logo, name, tagline, colours, background image and welcome message (set in Settings). |
| **Dashboard** | Today's and this month's sales, stock in hand and its value at today's rate, customer dues, vendor payables, today's rates, a 7-day sales chart, recent bills, upcoming birthdays and anniversaries, and low-stock alerts. |
| **Today's Rates** | Enter the gold, silver and platinum rates per gram for every purity. "Auto-fill" works out 22K, 18K and 14K from 24K, and 925 silver from 999. Every rate change is kept in a history with a trend chart. Billing uses the latest saved rate, and it shows in the top bar on every screen. |
| **New Sale / Billing (POS)** | Scan a QR sticker with the camera (**Scan QR**: keeps scanning, so several pieces can be added in a row; a photo also works), use a USB/Bluetooth QR scanner, type a tag number or HUID, or browse stock. Each line is priced as net weight × rate + wastage/VA + making charge (percent, per gram or flat) + stone value + hallmark charge. Rate, making and VA can be edited per line. Customer-group making discounts apply automatically. The bill also handles discounts, old-gold exchange (deducted after GST), CGST/SGST or IGST, split payments and balance due. On save the invoice prints. |
| **Sales & Invoices** | Search and filter bills, then view or print the branded GST tax invoice (with HUIDs and the amount in words), take payment against a due, or cancel a bill (its stock returns to inventory). |
| **WhatsApp** (Admin only) | **Wishes:** lists customers whose birthday or anniversary is due in 7 days (adjustable), with a send button for each and "Send all"; the dashboard also reminds you. **Promotional broadcast:** to all customers, by group or city, and/or all vendors. Contacts without a valid mobile, who haven't agreed to receive WhatsApp messages, or with a duplicate number are left out automatically. **Templates:** with `{name}`, `{shop}`, `{date}` and similar placeholders. **Message log:** with CSV export. |
| **Customers** | Customer list and profile: contact details, group, PAN/GSTIN, birthday, anniversary, ring size, notes, purchase history, payments and outstanding. Payments received are set against the oldest open bills first. |
| **Stock** | Every tagged piece with item, purity, gross/stone/net weight, stone details and value, HUID, vendor, location and value at today's rate. You can filter, add or edit pieces, view each piece's **QR code**, and **print QR stickers** for the pieces you tick (or every piece shown). Stickers come in three sizes: jewellery dumbbell tag 95×12 mm, 50×25 mm label, or an A4 sheet of 65 labels. You choose which details appear and the number of copies. |
| **Purchases** | Stock inward from a vendor: one row per piece, with tags generated automatically and GST on the purchase. After saving, the app offers to print QR stickers for the new pieces. Also records vendor payments. |
| **Vendors** | Supplier list with a ledger for each (purchases, payments and amount payable). |
| **Master Data** | One screen for every master list: Item Master, Categories, Metals, Purity/Karat, HSN & GST, Stone Types, Payment Modes, Customer Groups, Customers, Vendors, and Users & Roles. Every list has search, add, edit, delete (blocked while a record is in use), and CSV export and import. |
| **Reports** | Any date range, with quick presets (today, this month, this financial year, …). Every report exports to CSV and prints or saves as PDF. |
| **Settings & Branding** | Logo, colours (with ready-made themes) and a live login-page preview. Also shop details (GSTIN, BIS licence, state), invoice/purchase/tag prefixes, the hallmark charge, invoice terms, an optional live rate feed URL, users, backup/restore and an activity log. |

### Reports

- **Sales:** Sales register, item/category/purity-wise sales, GST summary by HSN (B2B/B2C, for GSTR-1), collections by payment mode, old gold received, day book.
- **Stock:** Stock summary and valuation (gross, net and fine weight), tag-wise stock detail with age in days, re-order list.
- **Purchases:** Purchase register, vendor payables.

Other master data also comes pre-loaded:

- **Purities:** 24K/999, 22K/916, 20K/833, 18K/750, 14K/585, Silver 999/925, Platinum 950.
- **HSN codes:** 7113, 7114, 7118, 7108, 7106, 7110, 7102 (0.25%), 7103, 7117.
- **Stone types,** payment modes and customer groups.

Demo vendors, customers, stock pieces and bills are included so every screen has data to show.

## India-specific rules built in

- GST at the HSN rate per line: CGST + SGST within the state, IGST between states. IGST switches on automatically when the customer's state differs from the shop's.
- **Section 269ST:** a bill is blocked if it takes ₹2 lakh or more in cash.
- **Rule 114B:** customer PAN is required on bills of ₹2 lakh or more.
- 6-character BIS HUID per piece, shown on the invoice and on tag labels.
- Old gold (URD) is valued at net weight after the melting deduction and taken off after GST.
- Document numbers run per financial year, e.g. `INV/2026-27/0001`.
- Amounts use Indian formatting (lakh/crore), and the amount in words follows the same system.

```

## QR codes

- Each piece's QR code contains just its tag number (e.g. `T1001`). The same sticker works with the in-app camera scanner and with any USB/Bluetooth QR scanner gun, which types the code into the scan box.
- **Camera scanning** needs the app to be opened over `https` (for example the GitHub Pages link) or from `localhost`. Some browsers block the camera when `index.html` is opened directly as a file; **Scan from a photo** works everywhere.
- **Thermal label printers** (TSC, Zebra, Argox, TVS, …): in the print window, pick the label printer, set the paper size to the sticker size and margins to none. **A4 label sheets:** print at 100% / Actual size.

## WhatsApp

There are two sending modes, chosen under WhatsApp → WhatsApp settings:

- **Click-to-chat** (default, free, no setup): WhatsApp Desktop or WhatsApp Web opens with the message typed in, and staff press Send. For broadcasts, the app steps through the contacts one at a time. Works with the shop's normal WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business app.
- **Automatic (WhatsApp Business Cloud API):** messages are sent without clicking, using Meta-approved templates. You need a Meta Business account, a verified business number, approved templates (with `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, … in the same order as the placeholders here), and the phone number ID plus a permanent token. Meta charges per message. In this prototype the token is stored in the browser, and only Admins can see it; before going live, move sending to a server.

The app runs only while it is open, so birthday wishes are not sent on their own on a schedule. Open the WhatsApp screen (or the dashboard reminder) each day. Fully automatic daily sending needs a small server; see the next steps below.

## Prototype limits and next steps

- **Storage:** data is kept in the browser (`localStorage`) on the computer where the app is used. Take regular backups (Settings → Download backup). To share data across counters or branches, replace `js/db.js` with calls to a backend API and database (for example Node or Django with PostgreSQL). All screens go through `DB`, so nothing else needs to change.
- **Security:** sign-in is checked inside the browser with salted SHA-256 hashes, which is fine for a demo. A production version needs server-side authentication.
- **Live rates:** set **Settings → Live rate feed URL** to an endpoint that returns JSON such as `{"G24K": 12850, "G22K": 11780, "S999": 165}`.
- **Possible additions:** scheduled automatic WhatsApp sending from a server, direct printing to label printers (raw TSPL/ZPL, no print dialog), sending bills on WhatsApp, SMS, e-invoicing/IRN, gold saving schemes, repair and custom orders, karigar job work and multi-branch support.
